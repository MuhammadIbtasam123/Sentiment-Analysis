Student: Hi Ms. Johnson! My presentation went okay, right? I was a bit nervous.

Teacher: You did great, [Student's Name]! A little nervousness is normal. The key points were clear, and your slides looked fantastic.

Student: Phew, that's a relief! I spent ages on those slides.  What about the audience questions? Did I answer them well?

Teacher: Absolutely! You explained the concepts thoroughly, and everyone seemed engaged. Maybe next time, try making eye contact with the class while answering.

Student: Okay, good advice. I'll definitely work on that. Thanks, Ms. Johnson!

Teacher: You're welcome! Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions for the next project.
